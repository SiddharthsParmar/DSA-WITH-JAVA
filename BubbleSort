Bubble sort Logic
bubble sort algorithm is used to sort array and list.

Logic:

So this algorithm works with  two integers 1st one controlls pass (round) and 2nd controlls comparison

for(i=0 --> i = arr.length-1) 

{
for(j = 0 --> j<arr.length -i-1){
compare arr[j] and arr[j+1] --> if arr[j] > arr[j+1] swap the elements
}
}

Code:
